                    Breathing Styles are swordsmanship forms practiced and taught by the Demon Slayer Corps. The Breathing Styles make use of specific and concentrated breath patterns, which increase the user's lung capacity and amount of oxygen in the blood. This increase of oxygen allows the user to enhance their physical abilities and mental concentration, allowing them to fight on par with Demons, whose physical prowess surpasses that of the average human.
                    <br><br>
                    Focused Breathing is also capable of clotting wounds from severe injuries and slowing down the circulation of poison in the bloodstream

                The Water Breathing combat and breathing style mimics water, specifically the flow, flexibility and adaptability of the liquid and replicates it with the user's movements, techniques and abilities.

                <br><br>
                This Breathing Style was originally created by one of Yoriichi Tsugikuni's students who attempted to learn the Sun Breathing, but due to not being as innately talented as Yoriichi, they were instead taught and trained an alternative personalized breathing style that focused on their strengths and weaknesses, eventually becoming Water Breathing.
                <br><br>
                It is said to be the most common Breathing Style among Demon Slayers due to being the easiest to learn for beginners

It can be assumed that this student attempted to master the Sun Breathing but, due to him not being as innately powerful as Yoriichi, his teacher altered his Breathing Style training in order to better focus on his students individual strengths and weaknesses. Eventually, his student continued to develop and train this style until it became its own unique breathing and was subsequently named the Flame Breathing. Since then, this particular Breathing Style has been passed down and taught through generations of his descendants and the future members of the Demon Slayer Corps.
