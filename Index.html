	      <p class="vinstriTexti">Street dance is a dance style that can be danced on any available open space, on the streets, at parties, at home, school yards, nightclubs and etc. It’s a dance that evolves every day. The reason is because this dance focuses a lot on improvisation and is social in nature.</p>
			<p class="vinstriTexti">People would gather together in the clubs, on the streets, at parties and other places, they would learn some moves and also show off their own moves and that was pretty much the beginning of it. But of course their most important aspect was the music. It depended on what music they were dancing to that decided how they danced and from that came all of the different dance styles of Street Dance. </p>
			<p class="vinstriTexti">Some of these dance styles and probably the most popular ones are: Breaking (Bboying), Hip hop, Popping, Waacking, Locking and Top Rock.</p>
			<p class="vinstriTexti">For most of us in the Street dance community, it is not just a dance. It’s a culture. We do not only listen to music and dance to it. It’s a lifestyle. There is art/writing (graffiti), there is rhythm and poetry (rap and beatmaking), music (DJ, parties, clubs, music making) and freestyling (improvisation).</p>

			<p class="haegriTexti">Many spend their life, their hours or free time into cultivating and learning Street dance and its culture. Being a part of it. We take hours and hours or even days to learning and defining our dance, practicing our dance. We turn on the music and improvise on the spot (freestyling) whether it be rapping, dancing or anything. We meet up and share our knowledge and show off. </p>
			
			<p class="haegriTexti">We compete with each other through many ways. A one on one dance battle, forming a circle where one guy goes in and dances at a time (cyphers) or any other fun competitive formats. We make and listen to the music, rap, rhythm, etc. Some do what we call “Writing”. Which is basically graffiti, some make music and beats, etc.</p>
			
			<p class="haegriTexti">Now each dance style has their own elements, aspects and foundations. A lot of which is connected or similar to the other’s. Without learning the foundations, you cannot dance Street dance. That is the most important thing.</p>
			
			<p class="haegriTexti">Each of the styles have a rich history and different origins and place of birth. But through time it all came together, even blended with one another. The dance styles took note of each other and incorporated each other’s moves and made it their own and becoming known under the term of “Street dance”. Street dance brings people together, it brings unity.</p>

	      <h1>History of Street Dance</h1>
	      <img src="break.png" alt="breaking">
	      <p class="nedriTexti">
			Street dance originated (or became known) in the 1970’s in New York. But as it grew, people and styles from other places such as Los Angeles and San Francisco in California would come and blend in and meet the dancers of New York. Which they then grew together as Street dancers.</p>
			
			<img src="pop.png" alt="popping">
			<p class="nedriTexti">Street dance was a big way for people to express and vent out their emotions and “story”. For the poor and urban inhabitants, especially minorities (Blacks, Hispanic, Puerto Ricans) Street dance was a big source of relief. Life on the streets was tough. There were gangs, violence and outlaws running around. People were doing a lot of bad stuff. Street dance aimed for unity and love, focusing away from the violence and bad stuff that was happening on the streets. At the same time it was also developed as an improvised and social dance form reacting against High-art, Jazz and mainstream dance styles.</p>
</p>
		  	<blockquote class="nedriTexti">
	      	“street dance was used as an expression of resistance and cultural identity outside of the mainstream.”</blockquote>

	      	<p class="nedriTexti">Street dance would also become competitive. In addition to dancing at the clubs or parties. People would do “Battles” and “Cyphers”. Battling being where one side (consisting of one or more dancers) would face the other and dance, trying to outdance the other. Cyphers is where the dancers form a circle and one dancer would go into the circle at a time and show off their move. Sometimes it would lead to people calling out each other in the ring to have a dance off. Then people started hosting events where there was a prize pool for the winners. Thus the battles would now have formats and judges. The common format being one on one or “crew battles” (group vs group) where one side would dance one round and then the other side does their round and that could’ve gone from one round of dancing to two or three rounds or even more. At the end, after all the rounds are completed. The judges would then pick the winning side.</p>
